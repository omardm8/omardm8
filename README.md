My name is Omar Daniel Molano, a software development student. Design has always caught my attention, things like images and many colors. But now that I am in the world of technology, I have realized that I like the subject of working with data and I am very curious about artificial intelligence. That does not mean that I leave aside the other branches of development, since I am passionate about everything I do.
I like soccer and spending time with my family
